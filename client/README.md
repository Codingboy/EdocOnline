This program offers a simple way to encode and decode files/folders.



## Useage

To encode a file or folder open the windows filebrowser, mark the file or folder, you want to encode, rightclick it and select "Encode".
Enter a passwort as desired and click "Ok".
The encoded file will be called "<name of original file>.edoc".

Note: You can not encode multiple files at once.

To decode a file mark and rightclick a file. Select "Decode".
Enter the password, which was used to encode the file and click "Ok".
The decoded file will be called like the original file without the ".edoc" extension.
If you entered a wrong password, a warning is displayed and the decoding is aborted.

Note: You can not decode multiple files at once.
      You can not decode files that do not have a ".edoc" fileextension.
	  Ensure you selected an encoded file. Otherwise the behaviour is undefined.



## Uninstall

Go into the installationfolder and doubleclick "uninstall.exe".
Click "Yes" in the opening dialogue.
Click "Uninstall".
Click "Close".
